## Overview: To find similarities between cryptocurrencies on the basis of a dataset
### Description:
We took the dataset, filtered it down to tradable currencies. Then we used PCA to reduce the number of features to 3. Based on this we were then able to visually represent cryptocurrency clusters. The next step would be to investigate the real-world reasons behind the formation of those clusters. But that would be for a future analysis.
